Knight Sequences

Pictured below is a keypad:

A B C D E

F G H I J

K L M N O

1 2 3

We want to find all 10-key sequences that can be keyed into the keypad

in the following manner:

 The initial keypress can be any of the keys.

 Each subsequent keypress must be a knight move from the

previous keypress.

 There can be at most 2 vowels in the sequence.

A knight move is made in one of the following ways:

1. Move two steps horizontally and one step vertically.

2. Move two steps vertically and one step horizontally.

There is no wrapping allowed on a knight move.

Below are some examples of knight moves:

A B C D E

F G H I J

K L M N O

1 2 3

A B C D E

F G H I J

K L M N O

1 2 3

A B C D E

F G H I J

K L M N O

1 2 3

Your program should first write the number of valid 10-key sequences

on a single line to standard out.
